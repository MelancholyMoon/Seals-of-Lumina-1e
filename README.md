# Seals of Lumina 1e

The LogSeq graphs of **Seals of Lumina (first edition)**, a brand-new TTRPG system written from scratch that features an innovative manual with tools for creating characters and campaigns, complete with original Project Lumina themed rules.

The repository is currently almost empty because the project is still a WIP (Work In Progress). Real‑time changes and all files are kept in a private repository until the first release. If you want to learn more, you can join the official Project Lumina Discord server:

## Project Lumina

**Project Lumina** is the name of the narrative universe behind which we are developing multiple pieces of content and products. Project Lumina is an open project for everyone. Anyone can take part, provided they give credit to the creators, to the project itself, and, where applicable, to any products already developed, can make fan-made content and release it as part of the Project Lumina universe. We also plan to launch an official public wiki where anyone can request to add their own creations, characters and stories.

**Seals of Lumina** is an official Project Lumina product, consequently, the events, species, universe structure, and the content within the manual are connected to Project Lumina and may appear again in other Project Lumina products.

## How to download the manual

The manual can be downloaded in two ways:

1. **Official method** — download the manual from "Releases" in the desired language, extract the ZIP file, and open index.html in your preferred web browser.

2. **Source method** — download the project source code by clicking "Code" → "Download ZIP". This will download all graphs in every available language. To use this method you must install Logseq and open the corresponding graph.

Use the official method for a quick, ready-to-read manual. Use the source method if you want to modify the manual, change settings, or apply a custom theme or plugins.

## How to use the manual

The main page from which you can access the manual is the **index**. It contains all references to pages and child blocks. You can easily find what you are looking for by chapter, or use the **search function** at the top left of the interface. You can also filter for pages or blocks by using the "/" symbol in the search. To make the manual easier and more comfortable to consult, there are many links to term references, which are mainly located on the **glossary** page. If you want to read the manual from beginning to end, or simply move forward or back between pages, you can use the **page links** at the top or bottom of the manual pages. If you want to access references and content on the page more easily, you can **hover** your mouse over a reference and wait a few seconds to see a preview of the page, reference, or block. You can also **left-click a link while holding Shift**, this will open the selected page or block to the right at the same time.

## Project status and releases

Some parts may be missing or still need to be implemented, others are complete or currently under review and playtesting.

The version we are currently working on is the **alpha** of the **first essential manual**. The edition in this repository is called **"1e"** (first edition), additional expansion manuals may be published in the future.

If a "2e" (second edition) or later editions are released, they will be published in a separate repository once that version is finalized and polished.

## Troubleshooting

Q: **Pages do not open correctly in LogSeq while using the source method. What should I do?**

A: Ensure the repository folder is a proper LogSeq graph (for example "Seals of Lumina 1e - en" and not the repository folder which contain all the graphs). Re-open the right folder and eventually if the problem persist, restart LogSeq and check file names for invalid characters. If problems continue, open an issue with details, and use the official method to view the manual.

‎

This section still needs improvement and expansion. If your question is not here, please open an issue with a clear title and steps to help us reproduce the problem. Thank you for helping improve the manual!
